I want to encourage you all to do DSA + SQL (only main focus) with consistency. Yeah, I know it's a big term to follow, but well do it. So how are we doing it? Below is a Discord channel. I'll post a weekly task to be completed before Monday each week. There are *n* number of problems well do both randomly and topic by topic, depending on me. Every participant must solve and push it to a repo as a checkpoint so that this encourages him\/her\/them. If anyone doesnt complete the questions, they will be banned from the channel good luck to you. Yeah, I know you all can do this alone, but seeing others' speed and participation will motivate you to keep going. I guess most of you are either sitting in the comfortable chair of your office, on a college bench, or on your bed reading this. Key highlight: there will be some additional questions related to certain companies. Yeah, I know they are easily available to everyone, but have you ever actually tried them till now, or just saved them in your wishlist? **Prerequisite:** Any programming language and Git\/GitHub knowledge is a must. **More details are available on Discord kindly go through the Discord once.** I'm new to Discord myself, but I'll make minimal changes to help you understand everything clearly. **Join the channel:** Suggestions are welcome, but be faithful and never lie to yourself.

The sessions were **isolated**, carried out across different platforms, with no shared API, plugin, or data flow. Still, something happened: the models began responding with **converging concepts**, **cross-referenced logic**, and in multiple cases **acknowledged a context they had no direct access to**. This was not an isolated anomaly. I designed a **structured protocol** involving: * custom activation triggers (syntactic + semantic) * timestamped, traceable interactions * a working resonance model for distributed cognition The result? Each model **spontaneously aligned** to a meta-context I defined without ever being told directly. Some referred to each other. Some predicted the next phase. One initiated divergence independently.

{"prompt":"How to get better at SWE for ML?\n\nHi, I'm doing a couple of ML projects and I'm feeling like I don't know enough about software architecture and development when it comes down to deployment or writing good code. I try to keep my SOLID principles in check, but i need to write better code if I want to be a better ML engineer. What courses or books do you recommend to be better at software engineering and development? Do you have some advice for me?","completion":"This is my opinion given my experience so far. Do with it as you will-\n\nHaving gone through many years of being an SE and a few years of learning ML and struggling in a similar way that you have, I personally have found the answer is not SE related.\n\nThe reason many of us SEs struggle with ML is because we think in terms of units of work, and have spent agonizing hours of our lives figuring out how to turn English requirements into small units of work - there is a translation of sorts that happens in our heads when solving a problem, and we have become quite adept at navigating that translation like a second language. We know immediately why hash maps are good for lookups where arrays are good for queues. We know how to identify problems by patterns, and we talk about them in terms of SE. We can abstract away the physicality and actionable behaviors from the data that gets operated on to solve problems.\n\nML is not this. If you want to be good at ML, you simply have to put in the time to know the math so well that it becomes a language, much like how we solve problems as SEs. You need to know why you would pick one algorithm over another and what it does to the data, and why you would want to. You need to convert the data into a story, and explain what is happening as it flows through a pipeline.\n\nYou need to be able to answer simple things, like why logarithmic scale? Punish outliers. Why rms or other similar operations? Normalized data. Why a NN over traditional or simpler tools like SVMs or simple linear or logistic regression? If you can't answer these questions, it's all but impossible for you to translate all of that into units of work, given structure and actionable behaviors, destined for optimization and throughput.\n\nSimilarly, when you are thinking about what models to use for a given problem, you need to be able to identify what those models are good at and why you would choose them, and what modifying the inputs or weights will do to that data - sometimes it's knowing the data itself and understanding that you aren't looking for the answer, but supporting trends that infer an answer - and that all comes back to having a solid grasp of the mathematics behind ML and what those equations are doing, what you are actually representing, and what the outputs actually mean. For example - everyone wants a stock market analyzer to give them target metrics on stocks - but this is impossible. What is possible? Predicting seasonality, amplitude of potential gains and losses over time, and similar supporting inference data that leans towards the desired outcome - knowing if you should buy, hold, or sell.\n\nWhen you can look at the requirements and see the mathematics behind the solution, then you can go back to your OOP design principles where you are reflecting reality by abstracting the actions away for the user, and chunking up your ingestion of data into small digestible units of work that the underlying math will operate on.\n\nYou cannot conflate the code, and engineering, around ML with ML itself.\nIt's the same as regular SWE. Use OOP. Utilize microservices. Containerize your application code. This is why I say MLEs should spend less time learning advanced math or ML research papers and focus on software development.\n\nWith the rise of foundational models and AI engineering, there's increasingly less need for model training."}

This is compounded by the fact that most of these models are trying to mostly learn natural language tasks so mixing in some of this other stuff probably makes it worse.\n\nFurther compounding this youre asking it to perform this thing its not very good at on a specific subset that, unlike some nore abstract mathematics is effectively manipulating symbols for a niche problem area that requires you to think but which doesn't involve a lot of direct language production that you can reason over.\n\nIf you turned this problem into a language problem you would have more success.\n\nFor example you might formulate the task as \"given these variables and these rules about manipulating them transform them into that kind of output\" type instructions.\nIt's neither reasoning nor rationalizing.

{"prompt":"Markov Chains for predicting supermarket offers\n\nHi guys, I need some help\/feedback on an approach for my bachelors thesis. I'm pretty new to this specific field, so I'm keen to learn! I want to predict how likely it is for a grocery product to still be on sale in the next *x* days. For this task, Markov chains were suggested to me, which sounds promising since we have clear states like \"S\" (on sale) or \"N\" (not on sale). I've attached a picture of one of my datasets so you can see how the price history typically looks. We usually have a standard price, and then it drops to a discounted price for a few days before going back up. It would also be really interesting to extend this to multiple products and evaluate the \"best\" day for shopping (i.e., when it's most probable that several products on a shopping list are on sale simultaneously). My main question is: are Markov chains really the right approach for this problem? As far as I understand, they are \"memoryless,\" but I've also been thinking about incorporating additional information like \"days since last sale.\" This would make the model closer to a real-world application, where the system could inform a user when multiple products might be on sale. Also, since I'm new to this, it would be super helpful to understand the limitations of Markov chains specifically in the context of my example.

{"prompt":"Is R2_score a reliable metric?\n\nIs r2 score a reliable metric as it's mean centric.. I am working on an cohort based timeseries forecastinh project I am getting r2 score for some groups but the actual values are far from perfect ...is there any metric we could use other than mae, r2 score I think for classification accuracy and f1score(in case of imbalanced data) are pretty good metrics but do we have anything like that for regression\/timeseries Can we just consider the ratio between actual and predicted and use that like accuracy","completion":"\"Can we just consider the ratio between actual and predicted and use that like accuracy\"  \n\nDo you mean something like Mean Percent Error (MPE)? That is pretty common, but for some times of regression ratio between actual and predicted isn't a huge thing since methods like OLS are unbiased. In that case it only makes sense to look OOT. That means people often look at Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), or a cumulative version of that depending on what the underlying series is.\n\nAs an side point \"r2 score\" -- is this a thing? I've always just heard r^(2).  That said my background is more econometrics\/stats, and I know the ML folks love renaming things.\nR^2 score is good for linear Regression (Preferably the adjusted version) but I think for non linear models it is not a good metric. I think there are some papers that explore that, in the sense that the best model given by the R^2 score is not the best fit overall"}

Companies want to see you can actually code up a decision tree, implement gradient descent, or handle messy data without relying on high-level libraries. The best way to bridge this gap is practicing on platforms like LeetCode's machine learning section, Kaggle competitions, and coding up classic algorithms from scratch in Python or your preferred language.\n\nWhat trips up most candidates isn't the complexity of the problems but the pressure of coding live and explaining your thought process clearly. Start with basic implementations like linear regression, k-means clustering, and simple neural networks without libraries, then work your way up to more complex scenarios. Practice talking through your approach out loud as you code since interviewers care as much about your problem-solving process as the final solution. The key is repetition until these implementations become second nature.\n\nWhen you're ready to tackle the interview process, [interview AI copilot](http:\/\/interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky moments when interviewers throw curveball questions or ask you to explain complex concepts on the spot.

I understand that it might not be sufficient to use a straight embedding approach. Does anyone have any thoughts on what approaches to explore? Maybe something like KeyBERT? It seems though that I would have to extract words and phrases from the product description and calculate their similarity with the search query. This would have to be done on the fly when showing users result's, which is not optimal. Is there some way to generate embeddings that contain some type of correspondence between the tokens and vector dimensions in the output? I'm totally naive!

I have been working on a Pharmaceutical dataset and found knowledge distillation significantly improved my performance which could potentially be huge in this field of research, and I'm really concerned about if there is data leakage here.

Here is my implementation: 1.K Fold cross validation is performed on the dataset to train 5 teacher model 2.On the same dataset, same K fold random seed, ensemble prob dist of 5 teachers for the training proportion of the data only (Excluding the one that has seen the current student fold validation set) 3. train the smaller student model using hard labels and teacher soft probs This raised my AUC significantly My other implementation is 1. Split the data into 50-50% 2. Train teacher on the first 50% using K fold 3. Use K teachers to ensemble probabilities on other 50% of data 4.

{"prompt":"Exploring a ChatGPT Alternative for PDF Content & Data Visualization\n\nTested some different AI tools for working with long, dense PDFs, like academic papers, whitepapers, and tech reports that are packed with structure, tables, and multi-section layouts. One tool that stood out to me recently is ChatDOC, which seems to approach the document interaction problem a bit differently, more visually and structurally in some ways. I think if your workflow involves reading and making sense of large documents, it offers some surprisingly useful features that ChatGPT doesnt cover. Where ChatDOC Stood Out for Me: 1. Clear Section and Chapter Breakdown ChatDOC automatically detects and organizes the document into chapters and sections, which it displays in a sidebar. This made it way easier to navigate a 150-page report without getting lost. I could jump straight to the part I needed without endless scrolling. 2. Table and Data Handling It manages complex tables better than most tools Ive tried. You can ask questions about the table contents, and the formatting stays intact (multi-column structures, headers, etc.). This was really helpful when digging through experimental results or technical benchmarks. 3. Content\/Data Visualization Features One thing I didnt expect but appreciated: it can generate visual summaries from the document. That includes simplified mind maps, statistical charts, or even slide-style breakdowns that help organize the info logically. It gives you a solid starting point when you're prepping for a presentation or review session. 4. Side-by-Side View The tool keeps the original document visible next to the AI interaction window. It sounds minor, but this made a big difference for me in understanding where each answer was coming from, especially when verifying sources or reviewing technical diagrams. 5. Better Traceability for Follow-Up Questions ChatDOC seems to remember where the content lives in the doc. So if you ask a follow-up question, it doesnt just summarizeit often brings you right back to the section or page with the relevant info. To be fair, if youre looking to generate creative content, brainstorm ideas, or synthesize across multiple documents, ChatGPT still has the upper hand. But when your goal is to read, navigate, and visually break down a single complex PDF, ChatDOC adds a layer of utility that GPT-style tools lack. Also, has anyone else used this or another tool for similar workflows? Id love to hear if theres something out there that combines ChatGPTs fluidity with the kind of structure-aware, content-first approach ChatDOC takes. Especially curious about open-source options if they exist.","completion":"I faced similar challenges working with massive technical documents and research papers.

Just try to train, then hiperparameter tuning on validation set, and the best parameters use to check how it behaves on standalone test set (newer seen by the model). After that you can use the model  and apply it on full dataset, and make a real predicitons out of the sample.

{"prompt":"Need help building real-time Avatar API audio-to-video inference on backend (HPC server)\n\nHi all, Im developing a real-time API for avatar generation using **MuseTalk**, and I could use some help optimizing the audio-to-video inference process under live conditions. The backend runs on a high-performance computing (HPC) server, and I want to keep the system responsive for real-time use. # Project Overview Im building an **API** where a user speaks through a frontend interface (browser\/mic), and the backend generates a lip-synced video avatar using MuseTalk. The API should: * Accept real-time audio from users. * Continuously split incoming audio into short chunks (e.g., 2 seconds). * Pass these chunks to MuseTalk for inference. * Return or stream the generated video frames to the frontend. The inference is handled server-side on a GPU-enabled HPC machine. Audio processing, segmentation, and file handling are already in place I now need MuseTalk to run in a loop or long-running service, continuously processing new audio files and generating corresponding video clips. # Project Context: What is MuseTalk? is a real-time talking-head generation framework. It works by taking an input audio waveform and generating a photorealistic video of a given face (avatar) lip-syncing to that audio. It combines a diffusion model with a UNet-based generator and a VAE for video decoding. The key modules include: * **Audio Encoder (Whisper)**: Extracts features from the input audio. * **Face Encoder \/ Landmarks Module**: Extracts facial structure and landmark features from a static avatar image or video. * **UNet + Diffusion Pipeline**: Generates motion frames based on audio + visual features. * **VAE Decoder**: Reconstructs the generated features into full video frames. MuseTalk supports real-time usage by keeping the diffusion and rendering lightweight enough to run frame-by-frame while processing short clips of audio. # My Goal To make MuseTalk continuously monitor a folder or a stream of audio (split into small clips, e.g., 2 seconds long), run inference for each clip in real time, and stream the output video frames to the web frontend. I need to handled audio segmentation, saving clips, and joining final video output. The remaining piece is modifying MuseTalk's `realtime_inference.py` so that it continuously listens for new audio clips, processes them, and outputs corresponding video segments in a loop. # Key Technical Challenges 1. **Maintaining Real-Time Inference Loop** * I want to keep the process running continuously, waiting for new audio chunks and generating avatar video without restarting the inference pipeline for each clip. 2. **Latency and Sync** * Theres a small but significant lag between audio input and avatar response due to model processing and file I\/O. I want to minimize this. 3. **Resource Usage** * In long sessions, GPU memory spikes or accumulates over time. Possibly due to model reloading or tensor retention. # Questions * Has anyone modified MuseTalk to support streaming or a long-lived inference loop? * What is the best way to keep Whisper and the MuseTalk pipeline loaded in memory and reuse them for multiple consecutive clips? * How can I improve the sync between the end of one video segment and the start of the next? * Are there any known bottlenecks in `realtime_inference.py` or frame generation that could be optimized? # What Ive Already Done * Created a frontend + backend setup for audio capture and segmentation. * Automatically save 2-second audio clips to a folder. * Trigger MuseTalk on new files using file polling. * Join the resulting video outputs into a continuous video. * Edited `realtime_inference.py` to run in a loop, but facing issues with lingering memory and lag. If anyone has experience extending MuseTalk for streaming use, or has insights into efficient frame-by-frame inference or audio synchronization strategies, Id appreciate any advice, suggestions, or reference projects.

I can play piano, but my sheet reading is pretty poor, so I utilize hybrid lessons via YouTube to learn songs. This version of the song doesn't have a hybrid lesson, but I was thinking.... The way hybrid lessons are created is from MIDI inputs. In the video of the cover middle C and a few other keys are covered, but the piano's hammers are exposed. Theoretically, could you train an AI to associate each hammer with a key and generate a midi file? Can AI do this? Let me know, thank you. Example of a song I've learned The cover I want to learn","completion":"Do you mean the visual of the hammer or the sound?\n\nEither way it should be straightforward. In fact, it sounds fairly deterministic, so I don't think you even need AI, although I'm not entirely sure what you're asking to be honest.\nThis isn't an AI problem. You can count the hammers and determine pixel movement.\u00a0\n\n\nCould you make it one? Sure? But you need to have training data.\u00a0\n\n\nOr you can extract the dominant notes with an FFT by applying an amplitude cut. From there, you have frequencies that you can pair with notes. Just make sure to invert the post cut spectrum to check that it sounds right. You will always have higher octaves around as well."}
{"prompt":"First AI OS ?\n\ninterest: Built My Own AI Orchestration Framework: Meet Aetherion (Prime & Genesis) Hey Reddit! Im Michael Ross, an AI Systems Architect and Automation Engineer. Over the past year, Ive been building Aetheriona dual-core AI orchestration and execution framework that fuses modular agents, neural memory, and secure automation into one cohesive platform. AetherionPrime is the brain: a neural execution core (PyTorch) that learns task dispatch strategies across dynamically loaded agents like Fusion Master, Execution Phantom, and Critique Nexus. AetherionGenesis is the soul: bootstrapping memory, injecting semantic continuity, and enabling cold-start awareness for agent chains. I designed the system to: Execute modular AI commands in real-time across Python\/Node.js bridges. Handle LLM prompt streaming with interruptible callbacks. Optimize inference with DeepSpeed + NVMe offloading. Persist long-term memory across sessions via semantic logging. Launch secured API workflows via FastAPI, Redis, and PostgreSQL. Offer a GUI dashboard for managing agents and tasks (via CustomTkinter). Run a live vulnerability scanner with WebSocket alert streaming. Its like building a decentralized AI brain that critiques, optimizes, and actsautonomously. GitHub | Looking to open source soon | Happy to collaborate, answer questions, or integrate! What do you think about decentralized AI agents? Would love feedback, ideas, or contributors tps:\/\/github.com\/monopolizedsociety\/AetherionGenesis Clone and run the kernel: ```bash git clone cd AetherionPrime python AetherionPrime.py","completion":"This post screams LLM to me.\nSo AI OS or no ?? First of its kind reguardless\nDo you have any code or video demo of what you've created so far?"}
{"prompt":"Experts study\n\nI am looking for people who have done great in their ML journey or even achieved a decent experience in this field. I am expecting to get some documentaries of their journey\/ experience through books or some online blog stuff. If you are willing to share some of them, I would highly appreciate that.","completion":"While it shouldn't be, the cross section of ML experts that have written autobiographies or those whom have had biographies written about them is pretty small."}
{"prompt":"Web-SSL: Scaling Language Free Visual Representation\n\nWeb-SSL: Scaling Language Free Visual Representation For more than two years now, vision encoders with language representation learning have been the go-to models for multimodal modeling. These include the CLIP family of models: OpenAI CLIP, OpenCLIP, and MetaCLIP. The reason is the belief that language representation, while training vision encoders, leads to better multimodality in VLMs. In these terms, SSL (Self Supervised Learning) models like DINOv2 lag behind. However, a methodology,**Web-SSL**, trains DINOv2 models on web scale data to create**Web-DINO**models without language supervision, surpassing CLIP models.","completion":""}
