{"prompt":"How to get better at SWE for ML?\n\nHi, I'm doing a couple of ML projects and I'm feeling like I don't know enough about software architecture and development when it comes down to deployment or writing good code. I try to keep my SOLID principles in check, but i need to write better code if I want to be a better ML engineer.\n\nWhat courses or books do you recommend to be better at software engineering and development?\nDo you have some advice for me?","completion":"This is my opinion given my experience so far. Do with it as you will-\n\nHaving gone through many years of being an SE and a few years of learning ML and struggling in a similar way that you have, I personally have found the answer is not SE related.\n\nThe reason many of us SEs struggle with ML is because we think in terms of units of work, and have spent agonizing hours of our lives figuring out how to turn English requirements into small units of work - there is a translation of sorts that happens in our heads when solving a problem, and we have become quite adept at navigating that translation like a second language. We know immediately why hash maps are good for lookups where arrays are good for queues. We know how to identify problems by patterns, and we talk about them in terms of SE. We can abstract away the physicality and actionable behaviors from the data that gets operated on to solve problems.\n\nML is not this. If you want to be good at ML, you simply have to put in the time to know the math so well that it becomes a language, much like how we solve problems as SEs. You need to know why you would pick one algorithm over another and what it does to the data, and why you would want to. You need to convert the data into a story, and explain what is happening as it flows through a pipeline.\n\nYou need to be able to answer simple things, like why logarithmic scale? Punish outliers. Why rms or other similar operations? Normalized data. Why a NN over traditional or simpler tools like SVMs or simple linear or logistic regression? If you can't answer these questions, it's all but impossible for you to translate all of that into units of work, given structure and actionable behaviors, destined for optimization and throughput.\n\nSimilarly, when you are thinking about what models to use for a given problem, you need to be able to identify what those models are good at and why you would choose them, and what modifying the inputs or weights will do to that data - sometimes it's knowing the data itself and understanding that you aren't looking for the answer, but supporting trends that infer an answer - and that all comes back to having a solid grasp of the mathematics behind ML and what those equations are doing, what you are actually representing, and what the outputs actually mean. For example - everyone wants a stock market analyzer to give them target metrics on stocks - but this is impossible. What is possible? Predicting seasonality, amplitude of potential gains and losses over time, and similar supporting inference data that leans towards the desired outcome - knowing if you should buy, hold, or sell.\n\nWhen you can look at the requirements and see the mathematics behind the solution, then you can go back to your OOP design principles where you are reflecting reality by abstracting the actions away for the user, and chunking up your ingestion of data into small digestible units of work that the underlying math will operate on.\n\nYou cannot conflate the code, and engineering, around ML with ML itself.\nIt's the same as regular SWE. Use OOP. Utilize microservices. Containerize your application code. This is why I say MLEs should spend less time learning advanced math or ML research papers and focus on software development.\n\nWith the rise of foundational models and AI engineering, there's increasingly less need for model training."}

There is always a LC round and ML round (knowing algorithms, implementation and pros and cons) you may have a ml system design round as well. And it all depends on the company and role.  For eg if it is a cv focused role then you might have to explain what a conv kernel is, implement it etc. what is dropout and how do you handle it at test and train time. Implement kmeans \n\nProtip: Ask the interviewer what the round entails - look at glassdoor\/ other sites for questions etc \n\nHappy Learning !!!\nWhich company? Because it's mostly dependent on the company you are applying for.\nYour self-taught journey is actually a huge advantage here because it shows real grit and passion that many candidates lack. For an associate level role, expect the technical round to focus more on practical ML concepts than hardcore algorithm implementation - they'll likely ask you to explain common algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or clustering methods conceptually, walk through your project work in detail, and maybe solve a basic data manipulation problem using pandas or numpy. The coding portion will probably be more focused on Python fundamentals and data processing rather than complex leetcode problems, though you might get some basic algorithmic thinking questions.\n\nThe fact that you've built your own projects puts you ahead of many candidates who only have theoretical knowledge. Be ready to discuss your projects deeply - what problems you solved, what challenges you faced, how you evaluated your models, and what you learned from failures. They'll want to see that you understand the full ML pipeline from data collection to model deployment. Given the job description mentions tools like LangChain and RAG systems, they're clearly looking for someone who can grow into these areas, so your self-learning ability is exactly what they need.\n\nI'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http:\/\/interviews.chat), and it's designed specifically to help with these kinds of technical interviews where you need to articulate complex ML concepts clearly and handle unexpected questions about your experience."}

Companies want to see you can actually code up a decision tree, implement gradient descent, or handle messy data without relying on high-level libraries. The best way to bridge this gap is practicing on platforms like LeetCode's machine learning section, Kaggle competitions, and coding up classic algorithms from scratch in Python or your preferred language.\n\nWhat trips up most candidates isn't the complexity of the problems but the pressure of coding live and explaining your thought process clearly. Start with basic implementations like linear regression, k-means clustering, and simple neural networks without libraries, then work your way up to more complex scenarios.

{"prompt":"Exploring a ChatGPT Alternative for PDF Content & Data Visualization\n\nTested some different AI tools for working with long, dense PDFs, like academic papers, whitepapers, and tech reports that are packed with structure, tables, and multi-section layouts. One tool that stood out to me recently is ChatDOC, which seems to approach the document interaction problem a bit differently, more visually and structurally in some ways.\n\nI think if your workflow involves reading and making sense of large documents, it offers some surprisingly useful features that ChatGPT doesn\u2019t cover.\n\nWhere ChatDOC Stood Out for Me:\n1. Clear Section and Chapter Breakdown\nChatDOC automatically detects and organizes the document into chapters and sections, which it displays in a sidebar. This made it way easier to navigate a 150-page report without getting lost. I could jump straight to the part I needed without endless scrolling.\n\n2. Table and Data Handling\nIt manages complex tables better than most tools I\u2019ve tried. You can ask questions about the table contents, and the formatting stays intact (multi-column structures, headers, etc.). This was really helpful when digging through experimental results or technical benchmarks.\n\n3. Content\/Data Visualization Features\nOne thing I didn\u2019t expect but appreciated: it can generate visual summaries from the document. That includes simplified mind maps, statistical charts, or even slide-style breakdowns that help organize the info logically. It gives you a solid starting point when you're prepping for a presentation or review session.\n\n4. Side-by-Side View\nThe tool keeps the original document visible next to the AI interaction window. It sounds minor, but this made a big difference for me in understanding where each answer was coming from, especially when verifying sources or reviewing technical diagrams.\n\n5. Better Traceability for Follow-Up Questions\nChatDOC seems to \u201cremember\u201d where the content lives in the doc. So if you ask a follow-up question, it doesn\u2019t just summarize\u2014it often brings you right back to the section or page with the relevant info.\n\nTo be fair, if you\u2019re looking to generate creative content, brainstorm ideas, or synthesize across multiple documents, ChatGPT still has the upper hand. But when your goal is to read, navigate, and visually break down a single complex PDF, ChatDOC adds a layer of utility that GPT-style tools lack.\n\nAlso, has anyone else used this or another tool for similar workflows? I\u2019d love to hear if there\u2019s something out there that combines ChatGPT\u2019s fluidity with the kind of structure-aware, content-first approach ChatDOC takes.

{"prompt":"Should I retrain my model on the entire dataset after splitting into train\/test, especially for time series data?\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI have a question regarding the process of model training and evaluation. After splitting my data into train and test sets, I selected the best model based on its performance on the test set. Now, I\u2019m wondering:\n\nIs it a good idea to retrain the model on the entire dataset (train + test) to make use of all the available data, especially since my data is time series and I don\u2019t want to lose valuable information?\n\nOr would retraining on the entire dataset cause a mismatch with the hyperparameters and tuning already done during the initial training phase?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on whether this is a good practice or if there are better approaches for time series data.\n\nThanks in advance!","completion":"I think that you have to split data into train, val and test sets. If you choose the best model just according to test set, you can get overly-positive results. Just try to train, then hiperparameter tuning on validation set, and the best parameters use to check how it behaves on standalone test set (newer seen by the model). After that you can use the model  and apply it on full dataset, and make a real predicitons out of the sample. That is just my opinion, but I think it is the way of \"proper\" forecasting.\nDo leave future out cross validation to estimate out of sample performance over time - if that passes whatever validation checks you set then retrain on all of the data you have available\nJust use auto gluon it\u2019ll handle the splitting for you."}

{"prompt":"Need help building real-time Avatar API \u2014 audio-to-video inference on backend (HPC server)\n\nHi all,\n\nI\u2019m developing a real-time API for avatar generation using **MuseTalk**, and I could use some help optimizing the audio-to-video inference process under live conditions. The backend runs on a high-performance computing (HPC) server, and I want to keep the system responsive for real-time use.\n\n# Project Overview\n\nI\u2019m building an **API** where a user speaks through a frontend interface (browser\/mic), and the backend generates a lip-synced video avatar using MuseTalk. The API should:\n\n* Accept real-time audio from users.\n* Continuously split incoming audio into short chunks (e.g., 2 seconds).\n* Pass these chunks to MuseTalk for inference.\n* Return or stream the generated video frames to the frontend.\n\nThe inference is handled server-side on a GPU-enabled HPC machine. Audio processing, segmentation, and file handling are already in place \u2014 I now need MuseTalk to run in a loop or long-running service, continuously processing new audio files and generating corresponding video clips.\n\n# Project Context: What is MuseTalk?\n\n[MuseTalk](https:\/\/github.com\/Winfredy\/MuseTalk) is a real-time talking-head generation framework. It works by taking an input audio waveform and generating a photorealistic video of a given face (avatar) lip-syncing to that audio. It combines a diffusion model with a UNet-based generator and a VAE for video decoding. The key modules include:\n\n* **Audio Encoder (Whisper)**: Extracts features from the input audio.\n* **Face Encoder \/ Landmarks Module**: Extracts facial structure and landmark features from a static avatar image or video.\n* **UNet + Diffusion Pipeline**: Generates motion frames based on audio + visual features.\n* **VAE Decoder**: Reconstructs the generated features into full video frames.\n\nMuseTalk supports real-time usage by keeping the diffusion and rendering lightweight enough to run frame-by-frame while processing short clips of audio.\n\n# My Goal\n\nTo make MuseTalk continuously monitor a folder or a stream of audio (split into small clips, e.g., 2 seconds long), run inference for each clip in real time, and stream the output video frames to the web frontend. I need to handled audio segmentation, saving clips, and joining final video output. The remaining piece is modifying MuseTalk's `realtime_inference.py` so that it continuously listens for new audio clips, processes them, and outputs corresponding video segments in a loop. \n\n# Key Technical Challenges\n\n1. **Maintaining Real-Time Inference Loop**\n   * I want to keep the process running continuously, waiting for new audio chunks and generating avatar video without restarting the inference pipeline for each clip.\n2. **Latency and Sync**\n   * There\u2019s a small but significant lag between audio input and avatar response due to model processing and file I\/O. I want to minimize this.\n3. **Resource Usage**\n   * In long sessions, GPU memory spikes or accumulates over time. Possibly due to model reloading or tensor retention.\n\n# Questions\n\n* Has anyone modified MuseTalk to support streaming or a long-lived inference loop?\n* What is the best way to keep Whisper and the MuseTalk pipeline loaded in memory and reuse them for multiple consecutive clips?\n* How can I improve the sync between the end of one video segment and the start of the next?\n* Are there any known bottlenecks in `realtime_inference.py` or frame generation that could be optimized?\n\n# What I\u2019ve Already Done\n\n* Created a frontend + backend setup for audio capture and segmentation.\n* Automatically save 2-second audio clips to a folder.\n* Trigger MuseTalk on new files using file polling.\n* Join the resulting video outputs into a continuous video.\n* Edited `realtime_inference.py` to run in a loop, but facing issues with lingering memory and lag.\n\nIf anyone has experience extending MuseTalk for streaming use, or has insights into efficient frame-by-frame inference or audio synchronization strategies, I\u2019d appreciate any advice, suggestions, or reference projects.
