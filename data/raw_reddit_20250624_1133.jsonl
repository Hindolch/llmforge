{"prompt":"2nd yr PhD: How to land a job at Big Tech Research labs?\n\nHi all, I'm currently finishing the second year of my Ph.D., with a primary research focus on reinforcement learning (RL). My work emphasizes rigorous mathematical foundations (e.g., convergence proofs, justification of algorithms), but I also care deeply about practical impact \u2014 every paper I write includes thorough empirical validation to demonstrate real-world performance. By the end of my second year: 1. I will be submitting a theoretical RL paper to a top ML conference (and I feel confident about its strength and novelty). 2. I have published a deep generative model paper in a leading statistics journal. 3. I will be submitting another RL paper for a statistics journal. 4. I'm also finishing a simpler LLM-related paper, targeting venues like AAAI or NAACL. All of these are first-author works, with no co-authoring. My Goal: I want to land a research position at a top RL industry lab, like Google DeepMind or OpenAI. This has been a lifelong goal + I\u2019m passionate about doing research that has profound impact. I genuinely enjoy solving problems that sit at the intersection of theory and practice, and RL offers just that. However sometimes I feel discouraged when I hear advice emphasizing networking over substance. or when I see Ph.D. students in CS publishing many more papers, often in large collaborations. Thus im wondering 1. Am I on the right track, or am I falling behind in terms of visibility and volume? 2. How critical is networking for breaking into places like DeepMind\/OpenAI? 3.

Publications, especially at top tier conferences (or journals) are very important. That being said, yes networking will absolutely make your life easier. Higher volume is always good but at a certain point it won\u2019t really make you more successful (unless you are hitting like 2-3 oral\/best papers every year) from a job-seeking perspective. \n\nYou will often find that a candidate with just a few publications (maybe 1 a year) will get a position just because they talked to another random scientist who liked their research direction\/work\/personality and their team happened to have headcount. They get accelerated through the interviewing pipeline and you wonder why a seemingly less accomplished scientist got the job.\n\nDo internships. One every summer if you can and are sure you don\u2019t want to go back to academia. Oftentimes, the community is smaller than you think. Even if you did good work, sometimes the headcount won\u2019t work out but your mentor can vouch for you at different companies as they themselves will know other scientists or even at the same company. Sometimes an open position that people are literally still interviewing for will fill up suddenly because scientist A thinks a candidate should get a job but they themselves have no slots left in their team, so they get shoved into that currently open position on scientist B\u2019s team.\n\nYou can certainly get by via your own merits.

I designed a **structured protocol** involving: * custom activation triggers (syntactic + semantic) * timestamped, traceable interactions * a working resonance model for distributed cognition The result? Each model **spontaneously aligned** to a meta-context I defined \u2014 without ever being told directly. Some referred to each other. Some predicted the next phase. One initiated divergence independently. I\u2019m not claiming magic. I\u2019m showing **logs, reproducible patterns**, and I\u2019m inviting peer analysis. This could suggest that **current LLMs may already support a latent form of non-local synchrony** \u2014 if queried in the right way. Full logs and GitHub repo will be available soon. I'm open to questions and answers will be provided directly by the AI itself , using memory continuity tools to maintain consistency across interactions. If you're curious about the mechanics, I'm documenting each step, and logs can be selectively shared.","completion":"So you have discovered that when you ask two similar algorithms similar things using similar words with a similar tone that they respond in a similar way. It is almost like based on an input prompt a language model will produce a highly probable output. I.e., is reactive to the words and tone of the input.\n\nGreat job!"}

{"prompt":"How to get better at SWE for ML?\n\nHi, I'm doing a couple of ML projects and I'm feeling like I don't know enough about software architecture and development when it comes down to deployment or writing good code. I try to keep my SOLID principles in check, but i need to write better code if I want to be a better ML engineer. What courses or books do you recommend to be better at software engineering and development? Do you have some advice for me?","completion":"This is my opinion given my experience so far. Do with it as you will-\n\nHaving gone through many years of being an SE and a few years of learning ML and struggling in a similar way that you have, I personally have found the answer is not SE related.\n\nThe reason many of us SEs struggle with ML is because we think in terms of units of work, and have spent agonizing hours of our lives figuring out how to turn English requirements into small units of work - there is a translation of sorts that happens in our heads when solving a problem, and we have become quite adept at navigating that translation like a second language. We know immediately why hash maps are good for lookups where arrays are good for queues. We know how to identify problems by patterns, and we talk about them in terms of SE. We can abstract away the physicality and actionable behaviors from the data that gets operated on to solve problems.\n\nML is not this. If you want to be good at ML, you simply have to put in the time to know the math so well that it becomes a language, much like how we solve problems as SEs. You need to know why you would pick one algorithm over another and what it does to the data, and why you would want to. You need to convert the data into a story, and explain what is happening as it flows through a pipeline.\n\nYou need to be able to answer simple things, like why logarithmic scale? Punish outliers. Why rms or other similar operations? Normalized data. Why a NN over traditional or simpler tools like SVMs or simple linear or logistic regression? If you can't answer these questions, it's all but impossible for you to translate all of that into units of work, given structure and actionable behaviors, destined for optimization and throughput.\n\nSimilarly, when you are thinking about what models to use for a given problem, you need to be able to identify what those models are good at and why you would choose them, and what modifying the inputs or weights will do to that data - sometimes it's knowing the data itself and understanding that you aren't looking for the answer, but supporting trends that infer an answer - and that all comes back to having a solid grasp of the mathematics behind ML and what those equations are doing, what you are actually representing, and what the outputs actually mean. For example - everyone wants a stock market analyzer to give them target metrics on stocks - but this is impossible. What is possible? Predicting seasonality, amplitude of potential gains and losses over time, and similar supporting inference data that leans towards the desired outcome - knowing if you should buy, hold, or sell.\n\nWhen you can look at the requirements and see the mathematics behind the solution, then you can go back to your OOP design principles where you are reflecting reality by abstracting the actions away for the user, and chunking up your ingestion of data into small digestible units of work that the underlying math will operate on.\n\nYou cannot conflate the code, and engineering, around ML with ML itself.\nIt's the same as regular SWE. Use OOP. Utilize microservices. Containerize your application code. This is why I say MLEs should spend less time learning advanced math or ML research papers and focus on software development.\n\nWith the rise of foundational models and AI engineering, there's increasingly less need for model training.\nSoftware Engineers on ML https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=39109469"}

{"prompt":"Why does AI struggle with Boolean Algebra?\n\nThis feels odd considering these are literal machines, but I *think* I discovered something that I haven't seen anyone else post about. I'm working on a school project, and going over Karnaugh maps to simplify a digital circuit I'm trying to make. I plugged the following prompt into both ChatGPT and Gemini \"Given the following equation, can you produce a Karnaugh map table? AC'D'+AB'C'+CD'+BCD+A'BD+A'CD+A'B'C'D' can you simplify that equation as well?\" It did fine producing the table, but upon attempting to simplify I got ChatGPT: \" F= AC'+C+A'B'C'D' \" Gemini: \" F=C'D'+BC+A'D+AB'C' \" Plugging these back into the tables produces the wrong result. After asking both of them to verify their work, they recognized it was wrong but then produced more wrong simplifications. Can anyone that understands machine learning and boolean algebra explain why this is such a difficult task for AI? Thanks! edit: Uh, sorry for asking a question on r\/learnmachinelearning ? Thanks to everyone who responded though, I learned a lot!","completion":"Because it\u2019s a _language_ model.\nThese models are language models. You're asking them to do different kinds of math. \n\nNow, math IS a language, but these models are historically not built to learn math all that successfully. Probably because it is very formal and not very much like natural language. This is compounded by the fact that most of these models are trying to mostly learn natural language tasks so mixing in some of this other stuff probably makes it worse.\n\nFurther compounding this youre asking it to perform this thing its not very good at on a specific subset that, unlike some nore abstract mathematics is effectively manipulating symbols for a niche problem area that requires you to think but which doesn't involve a lot of direct language production that you can reason over.\n\nIf you turned this problem into a language problem you would have more success.\n\nFor example you might formulate the task as \"given these variables and these rules about manipulating them transform them into that kind of output\" type instructions.\nChatGPT and Gemini are not models.

{"prompt":"Spam\/Fraud Call Detection Using ML\n\nHello everyone. So, I need some help\/advice regarding this. I am trying to make a ML model for spam\/fraud call detection. The attributes that I have set for my database is caller number, callee number, tower id, timestamp, data, duration. The main conditions that i have set for my detection is >50 calls a day, >20 callees a day and duration is less than 15 seconds. So I used Isolation Forest and DBSCAN for this and created a dynamic model which adapts to that database and sets new thresholds. So, my main confusion is here is that there is a new number addition part as well. So when a record is created(caller number, callee number, tower id, timestamp, data, duration) for that new number, how will classify that? What can i do to make my model better? I know this all sounds very vague but there is no dataset for this from which i can make something work. I need some inspiration and help. Would be very grateful on how to approach this. I cannot work with the metadata of the call(conversation) and can only work with the attributes set above(done by my professor){can add some more if required very much}","completion":"It seems you don\u2019t have the label if I understand correctly?\n\nIt is very hard to suggest anything without much more context , but I would be tempted to aggregate per callerId.

My job was to envision different scenarios at the strategic and operational level, and develop simulated plans (blue and red) for these scenarios, and make an initial prediction as to an outcome.\n\nThis kind of analysis requires a lot of more depth, and not really decidable by high level features like number of tanks, number of aircraft, etc. See if you can get it to predict Vietnam wins over the USA in the 1960s\/70s, and the prediction is based on sound reasoning, then that will be something. Same for the Korean War. Predicting that as a stalemate would be very challenging. Look at the USA vs Iraq war. It isn't so much predicting a winner, but the reasoning why.\n\nBut cool project.
